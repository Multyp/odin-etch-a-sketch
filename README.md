# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch is a simple web application that allows you to draw on a grid using your
mouse. It's inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy and is built using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript.

## Getting Started
To use Etch-a-Sketch, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The grid will
be displayed with default size of 16 x 16 squares. You can draw on the squares by clicking
and dragging your mouse over them.

## Prerequisites
To use Etch-a-Sketch, you'll need a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

## Usage
Etch-a-Sketch has a few features that allow you to customize your drawing experience:

* <b>New Grid :</b> Clicking the "New Grid" button will prompt you to enter a new grid size
between 1 and 100. Once you've entered a valid size, the grid will be recreated with the
new dimensions.

* <b>Clear Grid :</b> Clicking the "Clear Grid" button will clear all the squares on the grid and reset
them to the background color.

* <b>Pick color :</b> Clicking the "Pick color" button will open a color picker dialog where you can
select a new color to draw with.

* <b>Background color :</b> Clicking the "Background color" button will open a color picker dialog
where you can select a new background color for the grid.

* <b>Eraser :</b> Clicking the "Eraser" button will switch the drawing color to the current
background color, effectively allowing you to erase your drawing.
